              A broad range of electronic music genres made largely for
              nightclubs, raves and festivals. It is generally produced for
              playback by disc jockeys who create seamless selections of tracks,
              called a mix, by segueing from one recording to another.

              Pop music is the genre of popular music that produces the most
              hits. A hit is a song that sells many copies, and the latest hits
              are listed every week on the charts. To get on the charts, a song
              must be released as a single, although most singles are also
              released on an album. Songs that become hits almost always share
              certain features that are sometimes called the pop-music formula.
              They have a good rhythm, a catchy melody, and are easy to remember
              and sing along to. They usually have a chorus that's repeated
              several times and two or more verses.
