<h3>EDM:</h3>
<p>A broad range of electronic music genres made largely for nightclubs, raves and festivals. It 
  is generally produced for playback by disc jockeys who create seamless selections of tracks, called a mix, 
  by segueing from one recording to another</p>

<h3>RAP:</h3>
<p>Light knock, tapping sound or criticism, or a style of music where lyrics are spoken or chanted with reoccurring musical beats.</p>

<h3>POP:</h3>
<p>Pop music is the genre of popular music that produces the most hits. A hit is a song 
  that sells many copies, and the latest hits are listed every week on the charts. To get 
  on the charts, a song must be released as a single, although most singles are also released 
  on an album. Songs that become hits almost always share certain features that are sometimes 
  called the pop-music formula. They have a good rhythm, a catchy melody, and are easy to remember 
  and sing along to. They usually have a chorus that's repeated several times and two or more verses.</p>
